    One is the deliberate starting position. Deploys are still safe — the
    rolling policy starts the replacement before stopping the old task — but a
    crash or an AZ failure means downtime until ECS reschedules, roughly 30 to
    60 seconds. Move to two when that becomes unacceptable, not before.

    Seven days, not thirty. Logs are also forwarded to Fluentd, so this is the

    covers that. Anything needing a longer history belongs in the Fluentd
    destination, where storage is far cheaper than CloudWatch's per-GB rate.
